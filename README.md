## Business Requirements
1. The application accepts search input in a text box and then displays in a pleasing style a list of people where any part of their first or last name matches what was typed in the search box (displaying at least name, address, age, interests, and a picture). 

2. Solution should either seed data or provide a way to enter new users or both

3. Simulate search being slow and have the UI gracefully handle the delay
